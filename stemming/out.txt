In phys energy is the quantit property that must be transfer to an object in ord to perform work on, or to heat the objectnot 1] energy is a conserv quant the law of conserv of energy stat that energy can be convert in form but not cre or destroy The SI unit of energy is the joul which is the energy transfer to an object by the work of mov it a dist of 1 met against a forc of 1 newton 

common form of energy includ the kinet energy of a mov object the pot energy stor by an object posit in a forc field gravit elect or magnet the elast energy stor by stretch solid object the chem energy releas when a fuel burn the rady energy carry by light and the therm energy due to an object temp
